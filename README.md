# SYSTEM_LOG // EARTH_SIMULATION

> "The simulation isn't crashing. It's strictly following the new patch notes."

**The Simulation Log** is a satirical, "sysadmin-style" archive of human history. It reimagines real-world historical events (wars, inventions, disasters) as server patch notes, bug fixes, and feature updates for a digital reality known as `EARTH_SIM_C-137`.

## How to Contribute

We welcome new "Server Logs" from the community! You can submit a new event in two ways:

### Option 1: The "Non-Coder" Way (Easy)
Go to the **[Issues Tab](https://github.com/MarcelvanDuijnDev/thesimulationlog.com/issues/new/choose)** and fill out the "New Log Entry" form. We will format it and add it for you.

### Option 2: The "Developer" Way (Pull Request)
1.  Fork the repo.
2.  Open `logs.json`.
3.  Add your new entry to the top of the list.
4.  Submit a Pull Request.

### Style Guide for Logs
To keep the humor consistent, follow these rules:

1.  **Title = Fact:** The title must be the *real* historical name (e.g., "World War I").
2.  **Description = Lore:** The description must be "System Logic."
    * *Bad:* "People got sick."
    * *Good:* "Pathogen stress-test initiated. 40% of userbase disconnected."
3.  **Dates:** Use clean formats (e.g., "1945", "65 Million BC").
4.  **Regions:** Use `Global_Earth`, `Global_Universe`, or specific servers like `Europe_West`.
